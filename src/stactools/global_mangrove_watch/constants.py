DESCRIPTION = f"""This study has used L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) global
mosaic datasets from the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) for 11 epochs from 
1996 to 2020 to develop a long-term time-series of global mangrove extent and change. 
The study used a map-to-image approach to change detection where the baseline map (GMW 
v2.5) was updated using thresholding and a contextual mangrove change mask. This 
approach was applied between all image-date pairs producing 10 maps for each epoch, 
which were summarised to produce the global mangrove time-series. The resulting 
mangrove extent maps had an estimated accuracy of 87.4 % 
(95th conf. int.: 86.2 - 88.6 %), although the accuracies of the individual gain and 
loss change classes were lower at 58.1 % (52.4 - 63.9 %) and 60.6 % (56.1 - 64.8 %), 
respectively. Sources of error included a mis-registration in the SAR mosaic datasets, 
which could only be partially corrected for, but also confusion in fragmented areas of 
mangroves, such as around aquaculture ponds. Overall, 152,604 km2 (133,996 - 176,910) 
of mangroves were identified for 1996, with this decreasing by -5,245 km2 
(-13,587 - 3686) resulting in a total extent of 147,359 km2 (127,925 - 168,895) in 
2020, and representing an estimated loss of 3.4 % over the 24-year time period. The 
Global Mangrove Watch Version 3.0 represents the most comprehensive record of global 
mangrove change achieved to date and is expected to support a wide range of activities, 
including the ongoing monitoring of the global coastal environment, defining and 
assessments of progress towards conservation targets, protected area planning and risk 
assessments of mangrove ecosystems worldwide.
